# Submit Proposals
As a collective of developers and entrepreneurs, Psychedelic was born with the purpose of pushing the Internet Computer ecosystem forward, helping new projects, Open Internet Services, platforms, tools, and standards that would benefit the network grow and be developed.

## What type of projects are welcome?

As stated above, Psychedelic is focused on helping to develop key **Open Internet Services** to the Internet Computer (open protocols and services), as well as any standard, tool, or interface that helps grow the IC ecosystem, improves its experience, or benefits users.

Anyone can **open new project proposals** to be discussed with the Psychedelic DAO, request funding from the DAO itself (coming soon!) or the adjacent network/community associated with it that any token holder will be able to access (soon!). This space will grow based on the DAO's community evolution, and the transition towards a fully community owned governance system. 

Naturally, this proposal system might be subject to changes in the future, and this is the first iteration as we kickstart the community.

## How to Open a Project Proposal

The process to open a new proposal has **three steps:**

1. Open a new [Discussion] as an Issue for the proposal.
2. Once discussed, create PR with a Markdown file in the `Open Proposals` folder.
3. Once reviewed, approved, or rejected it will be moved to the corresponding folder.


### 1. Open a New Discussion
To make a new project proposal **open a new Discussion first as an Issue on the repository** to make sure it is discussed with the community and quick fixes / modifications can be caught early on to deliver a clean proposal for reviewing.

You can follow the basic [Discussion template](https://github.com/PsychedelicDAO/project-proposals/issues/1) to know what information needs to be included.

### 2. Submit your Proposal to 'Open Proposals'

Once your proposal has been discussed, and the technical details have been narrowed down and reviewed, you can move forward with a proper Proposal submission. Remember that it is important to go over the discussion phase to ensure no angles or details are missed, and the proposal can be complete and strong when presented.

**To Submit a PR with the Proposal:**
To submit a proposal, you must add a **markdown file** on the `open-proposals` folder in this repository that explains the proposal in detail. The markdown file must:

- Have a simple file name that represents the proposal.
- Follow the **[proposal template](https://github.com/PsychedelicDAO/project-proposals/blob/main/open-proposals/template.md)** at the bare minimum (extra sections/details can be included if deemed necessary).
- Include a link to an open discussion/issue, as simple proof of prior discussion.

### 3. Review Process

Currently, and until the transition towards a fully community-owned DAO governance system happens, review process will be done manually by the core Psychedelic development group in conjunction with community discussions on the organization's [community Discord server.](https://discord.gg/yVEcEzmrgm).

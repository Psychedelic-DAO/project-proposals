# Project Proposals
As a collective of developers and entrepeneurs, Psychedelic was born with the purpose of pushing the Internet Computer ecosystem forward, helping new projects, Open Internet Services, platforms, tools, and standards that would benefit the network grow and be developed.

Anyone can **open new project proposals** to be discussed with the Psychedelic DAO, request for funding from the DAO itself (coming soon!) or the adjacent network/community associated with it that any token holder will be able to access.
